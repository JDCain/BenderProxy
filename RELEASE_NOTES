v1.1.0 - Release Date: 20 May 2019
==================================
This release adds support for persistent or so-called "keep-alive" connections
to be used. This allows BenderProxy to enable scenarios like authentication
using connection-based protocols like NTLM. The proxy now defaults to using
persistent connections. To revert to the previous behavior of closing the
connection to the server on every HTTP request, set the EnableKeepAlive
property of the HttpProxy to false.

Additionally, it attempts to make multiple subsequent calls that should reuse
the same socket more thread-safe, and keep them from stepping on one another.
Unfortunately, the way this is currently implemented is likely to introduce
a performance bottleneck in the proxy, because only one request can be
processed at a time. A rearchitecture to allow parallel HTTP calls should be
created at some point.

Finally, this release fixes a bug in parsing of HTTP headers. Header names,
according to spec are supposed to be case-insensitive, and the proxy was
not treating them that way.

v1.0.0 - Release Date: 10 May 2019
==================================
This is the initial release of BenderProxy, which is an extensible man in the
middle HTTP proxy with SSL support. It is a fork of the otherwise excellent
FryProxy project. It was originally written because the original author needed
a way to monitor and possibly stub some browser request in Selenium tests.

This fork was created because the original project has dependencies on Log4Net
and uses code contracts. While there is nothing wrong with these two
dependencies, it makes it difficult to use the project in a monorepo, where all
dependencies are committed to the source tree, as all transitive dependencies
similarly need to be committed. Repeated attempts to contact the author and
maintainer of FryProxy to address these shortcomings were unsuccessful.
