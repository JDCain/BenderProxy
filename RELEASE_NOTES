v1.1.2 - Release Date: 29 May 2019
==================================
This release fixes two bugs in BenderProxy. The first bug is that if a socket
exception is encountered after shutdown of the proxy has been requested, the
proxy now swallows and ignores the exception. Since socket processing is
asynchronous, it's possible for the proxy to attempt connection after no
socket exists, and the exception is benign, since a shutdown was explicitly
requested anyway.

The second bug is in the processing of responses that utilize chunked
encoding. Previously, after reading the results of a chunk, the proxy tried
to read the length of the next chunk, by reading the next line of the body
stream. However, if there are no more chunks, this could cause the reader
to attempt reading past the end of the stream, causing an exception. To
mitigate this, after reading a chunk, the proxy now advances the stream
pointer two bytes, past the carriage-return/line-feed pair (CRLF) that
marks the end of a chunk. The proxy can then properly determine if it's
reached the end of the stream before attempting to read another chunk.

v1.1.1 - Release Date: 26 May 2019
==================================
This release changes the behavior of the proxy when multiple headers with the
same name are encountered. Previously, BenderProxy would concatenate the
values for multiple header instances with commas. However, parsing these
multiple values back out was nearly impossible, since the header value could
legitimately contain a comma. Now, the proxy concatenates the values using
carriage-return/line-feed pairs (CRLF), which the header value cannot
contain, because a CRLF pair signifies the end of a header in HTTP. This
enables the user to properly separate multiple header values when handling
HTTP traffic. Note that this is a proxy-only change; it does not affect
the actual HTTP traffic across the wire.

v1.1.0 - Release Date: 20 May 2019
==================================
This release adds support for persistent or so-called "keep-alive" connections
to be used. This allows BenderProxy to enable scenarios like authentication
using connection-based protocols like NTLM. The proxy now defaults to using
persistent connections. To revert to the previous behavior of closing the
connection to the server on every HTTP request, set the EnableKeepAlive
property of the HttpProxy to false.

Additionally, it attempts to make multiple subsequent calls that should reuse
the same socket more thread-safe, and keep them from stepping on one another.
Unfortunately, the way this is currently implemented is likely to introduce
a performance bottleneck in the proxy, because only one request can be
processed at a time. A rearchitecture to allow parallel HTTP calls should be
created at some point.

Finally, this release fixes a bug in parsing of HTTP headers. Header names,
according to spec are supposed to be case-insensitive, and the proxy was
not treating them that way.

v1.0.0 - Release Date: 10 May 2019
==================================
This is the initial release of BenderProxy, which is an extensible man in the
middle HTTP proxy with SSL support. It is a fork of the otherwise excellent
FryProxy project. It was originally written because the original author needed
a way to monitor and possibly stub some browser request in Selenium tests.

This fork was created because the original project has dependencies on Log4Net
and uses code contracts. While there is nothing wrong with these two
dependencies, it makes it difficult to use the project in a monorepo, where all
dependencies are committed to the source tree, as all transitive dependencies
similarly need to be committed. Repeated attempts to contact the author and
maintainer of FryProxy to address these shortcomings were unsuccessful.
